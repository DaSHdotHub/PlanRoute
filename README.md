# Introduction

This document presents the project structure for a web-based application that can significantly benefit various organizations such as ambulatory care services, drug stores, and similar entities. The primary aim is to develop an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that centers on key functionalities crucial for enhancing operational efficiency in patient or client management and route optimization. In line with the MVP strategy, certain aspects like patient or client data are deliberately simplified to meet the minimum necessary requirements for the application's effective functioning. This approach ensures a concentrated development effort on the essential features, providing immediate practical benefits.

The application is designed to streamline management processes and route planning, offering a straightforward digital interface for easy interaction. It employs modern web technologies to facilitate effective communication between the front-end and back-end via API and JSON. This is vital for ensuring real-time data exchange, a necessity in the fast-paced environments of healthcare and retail. Deployed on Heroku, the application guarantees reliable access and scalability to cater to the dynamic needs of various service providers. Beyond being a technological tool, this application is envisioned as a means to advance more personalized, efficient, and customer-centric service delivery.
